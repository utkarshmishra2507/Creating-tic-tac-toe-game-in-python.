# Creating-tic-tac-toe-game-in-python.
Tic-tac-toe in Python is a two-player game where players take turns marking an X or O on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If no one gets three in a row, the game is a draw.
